Individual Project:
Ticket Managing system for an IT department. An employee who has a problem can submit a request to IT in the form of a ticket. Tickets are implemented as an FSM. A ticket provides information about the requests or problem, which is assigned to a member of IT who works to resolve the request. Depending on the situation, tickets can be updated to several states: new, working, feedback, resolved, closed, and canceled. Users interact with a GUI to manage a list of tickets. Ticket lists can be saved or loaded from the menu. This program utilizes a finite-state machine, encapsulation, polymorphism, class invariants, and an interface.
